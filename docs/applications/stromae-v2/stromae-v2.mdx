# Stromae V2

Stromae is an application that is responsible for displaying surveys for internet surveys.

Today there are 2 versions of stromae in production

- Stromae : A legacy application that uses xml technologies (XForms questionnaires powered by Orbeon) and maintained outside the product.
- Stromae V2 : A React application in the new generative survey and active metadata pipeline

:::caution
This documentation refers only on the V2 version.

## Code repository

Stromae is an open source application. The code can be found on the [following repository](https://github.com/InseeFr/Stromae)

Unfortunately the 2 applications share the same repository. Branches concerning v2 normally starts with `v2-*`.

## Back-end

Stromae communicates with a Spring boot API. [Queen](./queen) and Stromae benefit from the same back-end. However this back-end is deployed for each instance.
